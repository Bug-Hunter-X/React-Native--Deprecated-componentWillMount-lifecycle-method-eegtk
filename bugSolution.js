The `componentWillMount` method should be replaced with `componentDidMount` for side effects that need to happen after the component is mounted.  If you are initializing state, use the component's constructor.  Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { count: 0 };
}

componentDidMount() {
  // Perform side effects here
}
```
